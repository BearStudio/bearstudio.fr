Figma is our design tool of choice at BearStudio for creating and collaborating
on user interfaces. We leverage Figma's real-time collaboration features, powerful
design systems capabilities, and developer-friendly handoff tools to bridge the
gap between design and development seamlessly.

Our team uses Figma throughout our entire design process, from initial wireframes
to high-fidelity mockups and interactive prototypes. We follow Figma best practices,
utilizing components, variants, and auto-layout to create scalable design systems
that ensure consistency across our projects and streamline the development process.

At BearStudio, we value Figma's collaborative nature and its excellent integration
with our development workflow. Whether we're designing a mobile app, a web application,
or a complete design system, Figma's flexibility and robust feature set make it
our standard tool for all design work.
