Manuela is an office manager with more than 20 years of experience in IT service companies, at the heart of the worlds of document digitization and video games. Always on the move, she juggles priorities, anticipates, coordinates, and drives projects forward with infectious energy.
Bold and ambitious, she likes to be everywhere at once and take on challenges without ever losing her sense of teamwork. The improv theater she practices with passion perfectly reflects her temperament: reactive, daring, and resolutely action-oriented.
