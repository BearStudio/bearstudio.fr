After a degree in computer science, I cut my teeth as a developer before becoming technical manager (CTO). My years at SmartPanda enabled me to work on other skills, such as management and project administration, while familiarizing myself with the "startup" mindset.

In turn, I then wanted to try the entrepreneurial adventure by launching my development studio. This is how BearStudio was born in 2016. Based in Rouen, but with an international customer network, our aim is to help project leaders bring their ideas into reality (website, application...). My primary motivation centers around helping people, holding mutual conversations, understanding each other, and ultimately, propelling collective progress.

I'm also one of the founder and organizer of Fork it! Community. I created this community after a simple observation: I couldn't find a community that was truly oriented towards sharing experiences while being agnostic regarding geographic location and the technology discussed. While traveling, I noticed that even the large communities, though influential in their region or tech specialty, often remain confined to their bubbles.
