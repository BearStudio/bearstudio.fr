Olivier Huber is passionate about software creation. For him, our profession is one of the few that allows us to bring an idea to life quickly and at low cost. He has spent 24 years working in development, consulting, and training for clients, schools, and associations. Introduced to agility over 17 years ago through eXtreme Programming, he became a convinced Agilist and later a Scrum Master. He gives talks (Devoxx, Mix-IT, BreizhCamp, …) on a variety of technical and non-technical topics. Former CTO of Zenika Paris, he is now a Senior Partner Solution Architect at Aiven.io.
