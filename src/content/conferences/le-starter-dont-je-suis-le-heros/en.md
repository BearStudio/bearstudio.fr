Do you like React? Unfortunately, sometimes it can be painful to choose the best libraries and to learn the best practices to build your new project ready for production. Many heroes have been lost for years because React is one of the most dense ecosystems.

We all would like to start our brand new project with the best possible solution already provided. Today, we would like to detail our technical choices and the best practices that we set up in our web-application starter named Start UI, with more than 600 stars. Our adventure is the result of many years of experiments on different projects, from which we took the best.
