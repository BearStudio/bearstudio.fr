Feedback from an administrative assistant in a development studio. Have you ever felt like a whale in Microcosmos? It happened to me... When I met a development studio on my career path. I had already tested a lot of different fields, and I was determined not to sign a permanent contract until I felt really good somewhere! But I had never found anything somewhat similar to BearStudio. I dove in without a bottle nor preparation into a world where we talked to me about agility, self-governance, but also about sprint, merge request, issue and a lot of other terms that I still don't master... In return, I talked to them about framework contracts, collective agreements, vacation management, accounting plans... One year and a half later, I'm still here, they are too, we learned to work together and to understand each other. I would like to share this singular but so enriching experience because frankly, I don't regret for anything in the world to have dared to launch myself in this professional and human adventure!
