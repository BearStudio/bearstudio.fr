You want to launch your startup? You have an innovative digital project?
Problem, you have no technical knowledge... or worse, you have implemented a WordPress website once in your life and you are convinced that computer development is simple and free...

To give you a real overview of the market (salary of a developer, production costs...) #nobullshit.
Finally, we will give some recommendations to avoid some traps.
