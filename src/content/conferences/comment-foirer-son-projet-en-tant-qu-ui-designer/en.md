As a designer, it’s very easy to sell a beautiful dream to your client. But it’s easier to forget that development is tied to budget and schedule. A bad design workflow can lead to poor UX for the end user, no matter how shiny the first design was.

But if you really want to fail your project, in this talk, you will see how to:

- Choose the wrong design software
- Choose the wrong fonts & colors
- Prevent design iterations
- Add inconsistencies (quickly)
- Make shiny design with only convenient data
- Deliver shitty mobile UI (even if most of the users are on mobile)
- Make the life of front-end developers a pain
