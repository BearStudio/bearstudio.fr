All cloud providers promise the same thing:

“don’t worry bro, your app will never fall down and you will be able to scale as much you want”.

Ok that’s great, but before reaching this point, I must ship this f*ck*ng app online?

And I am not a cloud expert, I just want to put my app online…

Moreover, Gérard wants it to be done for yesterday!

We will start with a quick overview of existing solutions, and then we will choose some of them to put online the combo: FRONT + API (+DTB). We will analyze the advantages, the drawbacks, and above all the cost of setting up solutions like AWS, CleverCloud, Heroku, Netlify, Gitlab pages…

he purpose of this talk is not to determine which solution is the best, nor how to optimize its shipping. I just want to share my experience and I hope to save you a little time when you will be confronted against this type of issue.

This lecture is mainly aimed at 3 types of profile: Full-stack developers or “jacks of all trades” Students who don’t know how to put an app online Managers who have to choose a provider but don’t know where to start
