What if, in 15 minutes, you learned how to save yourself hours of work? During this snappy presentation, I will introduce you to Firebase, Google's tool that allows you to develop serverless projects. Firebase offers authentication services, database, file storage, cloud functions and others, whose handling is extremely simple. These services allowed me to develop an entire application, in a few months and on my spare time.
