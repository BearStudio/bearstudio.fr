The goal of this talk is to showcase the real-world advantages of using a modern project starter like Start-UI to rapidly build and deploy a full-stack web application. By starting from scratch and going live during the session, we’ll demonstrate how much time and complexity a well-designed starter can save — from architecture and authentication to styling and developer experience. To make it even more fun and practical, the final app will include a live interactive feature that lets the audience engage with it.
